To login to an aws account using the CLI, you need to have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your access key and secret key. You can then use the `aws configure` command to set up your credentials.

```bash
aws configure
```

This will prompt you for your access key, secret key, region, and output format. Once you have entered this information, you can use the AWS CLI to interact with your AWS account.
